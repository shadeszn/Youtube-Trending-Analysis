# Youtube-Trending-Analysis
## Introduction
In this project we will do a deep dive into the YouTube Trending video data and draw comparisons and valuable insights from it. To determine the yearâ€™s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Trending videos need not be the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year. While studying this data we will be able to look into various information, such as the top categories of the trending videos, the regional preferences in videos, the average amount of likes, dislikes and views on a trending video etc.

## Dataset
The data used for this project has been taken from the [Trending YouTube Video Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new) dataset on Kaggle. This dataset several months of the daily record for the top trending videos on YouTube from various regions. For convenience of data processing and handling, I have chosen Canada, USA and Great Britain (basically where the video titles are predominantly in English, as to maintain uniformity accross the data) as the regions from this dataset.
